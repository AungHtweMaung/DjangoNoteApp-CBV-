# DjangoNoteApp-CBV-

I used Class Based Views. Authentication system for users includes in this note app. So you can create your own account, and you can signup, login and logout. Basic functions like CRUD are included in this project. You can practice by writing and reading codes. You may download and practice this note app project freely.
